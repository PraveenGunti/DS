What is data structures?
A data structure is a specialized format for organizing and storing data.
General data structure types include the array, the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. 
Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways. 
In computer programming, a data structure may be selected or designed to store data for the purpose of working on it with various algorithms.
Data Definition defines a particular data with the following characteristics.
•	Atomic − Definition should define a single concept.
•	Traceable − Definition should be able to be mapped to some data element.
•	Accurate − Definition should be unambiguous.
•	Clear and Concise − Definition should be understandable
Data Object
Data Object represents an object having a data.
Data Type
Data type is a way to classify various types of data such as integer, string, etc. 
which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data, the type of operations that 
can be performed on the corresponding type of data. There are two data types
1.Built-in Data Type
2.Derived Data Type

Built-in Data Type
Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types. 
For example, most of the languages provide the following built-in data types.
1 Integers
2 Boolean (true, false)
3 Floating (Decimal numbers)
4 Character and Strings

Derived Data Type
Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived data types. These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. For example 
1 List
2 Array
3 Stack
4 Queue


Basic Operations
The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations. The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure.
1 Traversing
2 Searching
3 Insertion
4 Deletion
5 Sorting
6 Merging
